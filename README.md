# Localhost Style

A custom index.php and CSS styles for your localhost.

## How to Apply

1. Copy `index.php` in the root directory of localhost (e.g. `MAMP/sites`)
2. Create a folder for each category (e.g. `MAMP/sites/workspace` and `MAMP/sites/personal`)
3. Rename `index-workspace.php` to `index.php` and copy it once into every folder you created
4. Open each `index.php` and apply the `active`-class to the current folder/category
5. Change and add links to the sidebar as you like
